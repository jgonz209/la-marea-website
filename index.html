            Charmander can be found in hot, mountainous areas. Charmander is one
            of the most well behaved Pokémons. Its feelings and emotions can be
            read by the flame on its tail. If Charmander is sick or damaged, the
            flame will flicker and become little and dull. When it growls, it's
            either angry or about to attack.

            Eevee has an unevenly formed genetic structure that is easily
            impacted by its surroundings. This helps it to evolve and adapt to a
            range of habitats. Eevee has the ability to evolve into eight
            different forms. Eevee can also change its appearance to that of the
            Trainer who controls it.
